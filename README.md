# Statistical Modeling of COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage and Effect inÂ Lund
In this project we try to determine the vaccine coverage in Lund, Sweden given quantitative societal factors. Linear regression is used. Rather than using a ready library, the analysis and statistics is done from scratch to gain and showcase understanding. In addition, the effect of vaccination is analyzed by looking at the reduction in the number of patients at the predicted vaccination coverage for the given municipality.
